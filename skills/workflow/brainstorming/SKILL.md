# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the
idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change —
all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The
design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get
approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
3. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
4. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
5. **Write design doc** — if OpenSpec/SDD is active, save to `openspec/changes/{change-name}/design.md`; otherwise save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`; commit only when your workflow/policies require it
6. **Spec self-review** — quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope
7. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding
8. **Transition to implementation** — if OpenSpec/SDD is active, continue with `sdd-tasks`; otherwise invoke `writing-plans` to create implementation plan

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent
  subsystems, flag this immediately. Help the user decompose into sub-projects first.
- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple
  questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if
  nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

**Design for isolation and clarity:**

- Break the system into smaller units that each have one clear purpose
- Each unit should communicate through well-defined interfaces and be testable independently
- Can someone understand what a unit does without reading its internals? If not, the boundaries need
  work.

**Working in existing codebases:**

- Explore the current structure before proposing changes. Follow existing patterns.
- Where existing code has problems that affect the work, include targeted improvements as part of
  the design — don't propose unrelated refactoring.

## After the Design

**Documentation:**

- If OpenSpec/SDD is active, write the validated design to `openspec/changes/{change-name}/design.md`
- Otherwise, write it to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Commit only when your workflow/policies require it

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec document, look at it with fresh eyes:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, or vague requirements? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? Pick one, make it
   explicit.

Fix any issues inline before asking the user to review.

**User Review Gate:**
After the spec review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding:

> "Spec written to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know if you want to make
> any changes before we start writing out the implementation plan."

Wait for the user's response. Only proceed once the user approves.

**Implementation:**

- If OpenSpec/SDD is active, continue with `sdd-tasks`
- Otherwise, invoke the `writing-plans` skill to create a detailed implementation plan
- In non-SDD mode, do NOT invoke any other skill. `writing-plans` is the next step.

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
