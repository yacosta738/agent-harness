# Jules CLI Skill

This skill enables the agent to interact with the `jules` CLI. It supports task assignment, session
monitoring, and result integration.

## Usage Guidelines (CRITICAL)

To prevent excessive and inappropriate session creation, you must follow these rules:

- **Local First**: If you can solve the task locally within your current environment (e.g., editing
  files, running tests, small refactors), do not use Jules.
- **Complexity Threshold**: Only use Jules for tasks that are:
    - **Large-scale**: Touching many files or requiring significant architectural changes.
    - **Isolated**: Benefiting from a clean, remote environment to avoid local dependency issues.
    - **Exploratory**: Tasks where the solution isn't immediately obvious and requires iteration in
      a
      VM.
- **No Proliferation (One at a Time)**:
    - Never create multiple sessions for the same task.
    - Never use a loop or parallel execution to spin up several sessions at once.
    - Wait for a session to complete and inspect the results before deciding if another session is
      needed.
- **No "Small" Tasks**: Do not submit tasks like "Add a comment", "Change a variable name", or "Fix
  a typo".

## Safety Controls

- **Approval Required**: If you are unsure if a task is "complex enough" for Jules, ask the user for
  permission before running `jules remote new`.
- **Verification**: Always run `jules remote list --session` before creating a new one to ensure you
  don't already have a pending session for the same repository.

## Core Workflow (Manual Control)

Prefer using the CLI directly to maintain situational awareness.

### 1. Pre-flight Check

Verify repository access and format.

```bash
jules remote list --repo
```

*Note: Ensure the repo format is `GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO`.*

### 2. Submit Task

Create a session and capture the Session ID.

```bash
# Capture the output to get the ID
jules remote new --repo <repo> --session "Detailed task description" < /dev/null
```

### 3. Monitor Progress

List sessions and look for your ID. Use this robust one-liner to check the status (it handles
statuses with spaces like "In Progress"):

**Check Status**:

```bash
# Extract status for a specific ID by splitting on 2+ spaces
jules remote list --session | python3 -c "import sys, re; [print(re.split(r'\s{2,}', l.strip())[-1]) for l in sys.stdin if l.startswith('<SESSION_ID>')] "
```

### 4. Integrate Results

Once the status is `Completed`, pull and apply the changes.

```bash
jules remote pull --session <SESSION_ID> --apply < /dev/null
```

## Error Handling & Troubleshooting

- **Repository Not Found**: Verify format with `jules remote list --repo`. It must match the GitHub
  path.
- **TTY Errors**: Always use `< /dev/null` for non-interactive automation with the raw `jules`
  command.
- **Credentials**: If you see login errors, ensure `HOME` is set correctly or run `jules login`.

## Command Reference

| Command                       | Purpose                                                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `jules remote list --repo`    | Verify available repositories and their exact names.     |
| `jules remote list --session` | List active and past sessions to check status.           |
| `jules remote new`            | Create a new coding task.                                |
| `jules remote pull`           | Apply changes from a completed session.                  |
| `jules teleport <id>`         | Clone and apply changes (useful for fresh environments). |
